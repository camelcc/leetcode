Issues in whitelist is easy & simple so don't need to revisited after one time pass. Issues in Grey list need to revisited one more time (or 2~3 times) if necessary, but should be easy and simple too. Issues in blacklist is important and need many effect to solve and revisit from time to time.

All solutions aimed to achieve high performance and easy to understand goal.
